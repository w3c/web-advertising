# Improving Web Advertising BG
## Overview
The Improving Web Advertising Business Group supports privacy-preserving advertising and measurement on the web. We host ecoystem-wide participation, including individual users, browsers, publishers, advertisers, and advertising technology providers. The group has been collecting use cases, success criteria, and proposals. 

## How we work
### Business Group
The Business Group is open to anyone, on the payment of an organizational [participation fee](http://www.w3.org/community/about/fees/) or W3C Membership. 


## Documents

Group participants have created a number of documents in the [web-advertising github repository](https://github.com/w3c/web-advertising/). At this stage they represent unofficial drafts, produced by one or more indivdiuals, without any indication of group-level consensus. 


Just as formal Recommendation-track documents in W3C have a "Status of
this document" section near the top, describing who produced them and
their maturity level[1](https://www.w3.org/2019/Process-20190301/#general-requirements), I suggest that we do the same for drafts in the
Business Group. In many cases, the status will be "Unofficial Draft" --
something an individual or group of individuals has produced for
discussion. An Unofficial Draft doesn't need to reflect consensus, and
should make clear that it doesn't speak for the group or have W3C
endorsement. Individuals and organizations are free to express their
support, and it can be useful to others to see that.

For example:
### Status of this document 
    This document is a draft for discussion in the Improving Web Advertising
    Business Group. It has no official standing of any kind and does not
    represent the support or consensus of any standards organization.

If we want to develop more formal documents, Business Group Drafts or
Reports, or to describe "Business Group support" for a document, then we
would need to gather group consensus on texts.

## Communications
### Calls

The group meets in weekly teleconferences (currently Tuesday at 1600 UTC/11 Eastern). Agendas are shared the day before. Connection information is available to group participants.

To request time on an upcoming agenda, participants should email the list with "Subject: agenda+ [topic]". 

### Mailing List

We use the mailing list [public-web-adv](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-web-adv/) for public communications. 

### IRC

We use irc, [irc.w3.org](http://irc.w3.org/) channel #web-adv to take minutes during meetings. [Guide to irc at W3C](https://www.w3.org/wiki/IRC)
q+ to add yourself to the speaking queue. 

## GitHub Issues and comments
Raise questions or suggest new material in issues or pull requests. 
_Open question: who reviews and approves PRs on an existing document?_

## Confidentiality
The mailing list, github repository, and call minutes are public.

The group may host discussions under [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/chatham-house-rule), in which outcomes may be shared without attribution. 

## W3C
World Wide Web Consortium produces voluntary consensus standards: cooperative solutions for open, interoperable platform improvement. [The Art of Consensus](https://www.w3.org/Guide/)

Standards work well for: 
* Shared technical problem
* Good enough technical solution 
* Ecosystem interest in common resolution

W3C provides the forum and process: community and membership develop the specifications.
